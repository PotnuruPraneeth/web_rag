Langchain components LangChain is a powerful framework for building applications that use Large Language Models (LLMs). It modularizes LLM workflows into reusable and extensible components, allowing developers to create complex applications like chatbots, agents, and RAG pipelines. 1. Models (LLMs, ChatModels) Purpose: To interact with language models like OpenAI’s GPT, Anthropic, HuggingFace, etc. Types: LLM:… Continue reading Gen-AI Developer Classroom notes 15/Apr/2025
