Or do you cover a broader range of topics? I'm particularly interested in how people are using generative AI for image creation, text generation, and even music composition. I've been reading a lot about the ethical considerations surrounding the use of these technologies, too, like the potential for misuse and the importance of responsible development.\\n\\nI'm also curious about the challenges you face when teaching Generative AI Development.

    "Reflecting Telescope (Newtonian Telescope)\n",
    "\n",
    "Newton invented the first practical reflecting telescope in 1668, using a curved mirror instead of lenses to focus light. This design, known as the Newtonian telescope, solved the problem of chromatic aberration found in refracting telescopes and is still widely used today.\n",

    "Law of Universal Gravitation: Described the gravitational force acting between all masses.\n",

    "Calculus: Independently developed the mathematical system of calculus (called \"the method of fluxions\"), enabling precise analysis of change and motion.\n",

    "Binomial Theorem: Generalized the binomial theorem to include negative and fractional exponents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Newton-Raphson Method: Developed an iterative numerical method for finding roots of equations.\n",

    "Optics: Demonstrated that white light is composed of different colors, using prisms to show the spectrum and laying the foundation for modern optics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Empirical Law of Cooling: Formulated the first law of heat transfer, now fundamental in thermodynamics.\n",
